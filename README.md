# GrowMyTherapy – High-Fidelity Therapy Website (Frontend Case Study)

## Overview

This project is a high-fidelity frontend build recreating a modern therapy website with strong emphasis on visual hierarchy, responsiveness, and user-centered design.

Beyond visual accuracy, the interface was intentionally structured to deliver a calm, intuitive experience aligned with how therapy clients interact with digital platforms.

## Project Goals

- Recreate a professional therapy homepage with pixel-level precision  
- Preserve layout rhythm, typography, and spacing  
- Ensure seamless responsiveness across devices  
- Implement scalable and maintainable styling practices  
- Deliver a production-ready static build

## Approach & Engineering Focus

While recreating the interface, the objective extended beyond visual replication toward building a structured and scalable frontend architecture.

Key considerations included:

- Prioritizing readability and cognitive comfort  
- Establishing consistent visual hierarchy  
- Using whitespace intentionally to guide user attention  
- Structuring reusable UI components for scalability  
- Ensuring predictable responsive behavior  

This approach reflects modern frontend practices where usability, clarity, and maintainability are as critical as visual accuracy.

## Key Outcomes

- Translated a real design reference into production-ready UI  
- Strengthened component-based architecture skills  
- Implemented a fully responsive layout system  
- Practiced shipping modern web applications using Next.js  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Reusable UI components**
- **CSS variables for theme consistency**
- **Static site export**
